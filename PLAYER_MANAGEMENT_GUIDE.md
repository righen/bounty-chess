## 💡 **Tips for Tournament Day**

1. **Import main list first**: Use CSV import for your registered players
2. **Keep space for walk-ins**: Don't start tournament until all players arrive
3. **Double-check**: Review the player list before starting Round 1
4. **Export backup**: Click "Export Data" after importing players
5. **No editing during games**: Once Round 1 starts, player list is locked

---

## 📞 **Common Questions**

### **Q: Can I add a player after Round 1 starts?**
A: No, the player list is locked once the tournament begins. This prevents pairing issues.

### **Q: What if I made a mistake in a player's name?**
A: Before Round 1: Click Edit and fix it. After Round 1: Export data, reset tournament, reimport with corrections.

### **Q: Do I need to know the player's birthdate?**
A: No, but it's recommended! Without it, protections (U10/U16/Women) won't apply correctly.

### **Q: Can I add more than 70 players?**
A: Yes! The system supports unlimited players, but the Swiss pairing works best with 70 players for 9 rounds.

### **Q: What if two players have the same ID number?**
A: Don't worry! The system auto-generates unique IDs. Just leave the Player Number field empty.
